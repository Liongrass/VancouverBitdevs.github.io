### Presentation

Merchant maps, how we discover shop

- Magazines
- Stickers at the door
- Targeted promotions

Bitcoin merchant adoption starting around 2012

**How do discover merchants that accept bitcoin?**

- OpenStreetMaps is open source and adaptable through tags
- [Coinmap](https://coinmap.org/) began displaying this data through an easy to navigate web interface
- [CoinATMRadar](https://coinatmradar.com/) began building its own proprietary database
- Point of Sale services may have their own proprietary maps, e.g. [IBEXMercado](https://www.ibexmercado.com/ibex-pay)

**The case for OpenStreetMaps**

- Open
- Wiki-style editing process (or use a [web form](https://www.btcmap.org/add-location))
- Adaptable
- Easy to build on top of or integrate, e.g. local communities or payment processors
- Data is often mirrored into corporate competitors

Tags commonly used:

```
currency:XBT=yes
payment:onchain=no
payment:lightning=yes
payment:lightning_contactless=yes
survey:date=yyyy-mm-dd
```
